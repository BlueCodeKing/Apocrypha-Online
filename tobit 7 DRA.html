            <p>1. And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with joy.</p>

            <p>2. And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to Anna his wife: How like is this young man to my cousin?</p>

            <p>3. And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?</p>

            <p>4. But they said: We are of the tribe of Nephtali, of the captive of Ninive.</p>

            <p>5. And Raguel said to them: Do you know Tobias my brother? And they said: We know him.</p>

            <p>6. And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young man's father.</p>

            <p>7. And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears, and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.</p>

            <p>8. And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.</p>

            <p>9. And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,</p>

            <p>10. Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.</p>

            <p>11. Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her: and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,</p>

            <p>12. The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.</p>

            <p>13. Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.</p>

            <p>14. And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.</p>

            <p>15. And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfill his blessing in you.</p>

            <p>16. And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.</p>

            <p>17. And afterwards they made merry, blessing God.</p>

            <p>18. And Raguel called to him Anna his wife, and bade her prepare another chamber.</p>

            <p>19. And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.</p>

            <p>20. And she said to her: Be of good cheer, my daughter: the Lord of heaven give thee joy for the trouble thou hast undergone.</p>
