            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 21 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more: but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.</p>

            <p>2. Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee.</p>

            <p>3. The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men.</p>

            <p>4. All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no remedy for the wound thereof.</p>

            <p>5. Injuries and wrongs will waste riches: and the house that is very rich shall be brought to nothing by pride: so the substance of the proud shall be rooted out.</p>

            <p>6. The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of God, and judgment shall come for him speedily.</p>

            <p>7. He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner: and he that feareth God will turn to his own heart.</p>

            <p>8. He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off, but a wise man knoweth to slip by him.</p>

            <p>9. He that buildeth his house at other men's charges, is as he that gathereth himself stones to build in the winter.</p>

            <p>10. The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together, and the end of them is a flame of fire.</p>

            <p>11. The way of sinners is made plain with stones, and in their end is hell, and darkness, and pains.</p>

            <p>12. He that keepeth justice shall get the understanding thereof.</p>

            <p>13. The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and understanding.</p>

            <p>14. He that is not wise in good, will not be taught.</p>

            <p>15. But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil: and there is no understanding where there is bitterness.</p>

            <p>16. The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood, and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life.</p>

            <p>17. The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, and no wisdom at all shall it hold.</p>

            <p>18. A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear, and will apply it to himself: the luxurious man hath heard it, and it shall displease him, and he will cast it behind his back.</p>

            <p>19. The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but in the lips of the wise, grace shall be found.</p>

            <p>20. The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church, and they will think upon his words in their hearts.</p>

            <p>21. As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense.</p>

            <p>22. Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.</p>

            <p>23. A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter: but a wise man will scarce laugh low to himself.</p>

            <p>24. Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.</p>

            <p>25. The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbour's house: but a man of experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty.</p>

            <p>26. A fool will peep through the window into the house: but he that is well taught will stand without.</p>

            <p>27. It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door: and a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.</p>

            <p>28. The lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things but the words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance.</p>

            <p>29. The heart of fools is in their mouth: and the mouth of wise men is in their heart.</p>

            <p>30. While the ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own soul.</p>

            <p>31. The talebearer shall defile his own soul, and shall be hated by all: and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful: the silent and wise man shall be honoured.</p>
