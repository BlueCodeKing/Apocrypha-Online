            <h1><a href="index.html">Wisdom of Solomon</a></h1>
            <h2><a href="wisdom of solomon DRA.html">Chapter 4 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. O how beautiful is the chaste generation with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both with God and with men.</p>
            
            <p>2. When it is present, they imitate it: and they desire it when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.</p>

            <p>3. But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.</p>

            <p>4. And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.</p>

            <p>5. For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.</p>

            <p>6. For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.</p>

            <p>7. But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.</p>

            <p>8. For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.</p>

            <p>9. And a spotless life is old age.</p>

            <p>10. He pleased God and was beloved, and living among sinners he was translated.</p>

            <p>11. He was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.</p>

            <p>12. For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things, and the wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind.</p>

            <p>13. Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time:</p>

            <p>14. For his soul pleased God: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:</p>

            <p>15. That the grace of God, and his mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.</p>

            <p>16. But the just that is dead, condemneth the wicked that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust.</p>

            <p>17. For they shall see the end of the wise man, and shall not understand what God hath designed for him, and why the Lord hath set him in safety.</p>

            <p>18. They shall see him, and shall despise him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.</p>

            <p>19. And they shall fall after this without honour, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.</p>

            <p>20. They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them.</p>
