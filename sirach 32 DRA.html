            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 32 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Have they made thee ruler? be not lifted up: be among them as one of them.</p>

            <p>2. Have care of them, and so sit down, and when thou hast acquitted thyself of all thy charge, take thy place:</p>

            <p>3. That thou mayst rejoice for them, and receive a crown as an ornament of grace, and get the honour of the contribution.</p>

            <p>4. Speak, thou that art elder: for it becometh thee,</p>

            <p>5. To speak the first word with care knowledge, and hinder not music.</p>

            <p>6. Where there is no hearing, pour out words, and be not lifted up out season with thy wisdom.</p>

            <p>7. A concert of music in a banquet wine is as a carbuncle set in gold.</p>

            <p>8. As a signet of an emerald in a work of gold: so is the melody of music with pleasant and moderate wine.</p>

            <p>9. Hear in silence, and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.</p>

            <p>10. Young man, scarcely speak in thy own cause.</p>

            <p>11. If thou be asked twice, let thy answer be short.</p>

            <p>12. In many things be as if thou wert ignorant, and hear in silence and withal seeking.</p>

            <p>13. In the company of great men bake not upon thee: and when the ancients are present, speak not much.</p>

            <p>14. Before a storm goeth lightning: and before shamefacedness goeth favour: and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.</p>

            <p>15. And at the time of rising be not slack: but be first to run home to thy house, and there withdraw thyself, and there take thy pastime.</p>

            <p>16. And do what thou hast a mind, but not in sin or proud speech.</p>

            <p>17. And for all these things bless the Lord, that made thee, and that replenisheth thee with all his good things.</p>

            <p>18. He that feareth the Lord, will receive his discipline: and they that will seek him early, shall find a blessing.</p>

            <p>19. He that seeketh the law, shall be filled with it: and he that dealeth deceitfully, shall meet with a stumblingblock therein.</p>

            <p>20. They that fear the Lord, shall find just judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.</p>

            <p>21. A sinful man will flee reproof, and will find an excuse according to his will.</p>

            <p>22. A man of counsel will not neglect understanding, a strange and proud man will not dread fear:</p>

            <p>23. Even after he hath done with fear without counsel, he shall be controlled by the things of his own seeking.</p>

            <p>24. My son, do thou nothing without counsel, and thou shalt not repent when thou hast done.</p>

            <p>25. Go not in the way of ruin, and thou shalt not stumble against the stones; trust not thyself to a rugged may, lest thou set a stumblingblock to thy soul.</p>

            <p>26. And beware of thy own children, and take heed of them of thy household.</p>

            <p>27. In every work of thine regard thy soul in faith: for this is the keeping of the commandments.</p>

            <p>28. He that believeth God, taketh heed to the commandments: and he that trusteth in him, shall fare never the worse.</p>
