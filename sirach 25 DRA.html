            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 25 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:</p>

            <p>2. The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.</p>

            <p>3. Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:</p>

            <p>4. A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.</p>

            <p>5. The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?</p>

            <p>6. O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!</p>

            <p>7. O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!</p>

            <p>8. Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.</p>

            <p>9. Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.</p>

            <p>10. A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.</p>

            <p>11. Blessed is he. that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.</p>

            <p>12. Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.</p>

            <p>13. How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.</p>

            <p>14. The fear of God hath set itself above all things:</p>

            <p>15. Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?</p>

            <p>16. The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.</p>

            <p>17. The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.</p>

            <p>18. And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:</p>

            <p>19. And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:</p>

            <p>20. And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:</p>

            <p>21. And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</p>

            <p>22. There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:</p>

            <p>23. And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.</p>

            <p>24. The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,</p>

            <p>25. Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.</p>

            <p>26. All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.</p>

            <p>27. As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.</p>

            <p>28. Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.</p>

            <p>29. A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.</p>

            <p>30. A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.</p>

            <p>31. A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.</p>

            <p>32. Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.</p>

            <p>33. From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.</p>

            <p>34. Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.</p>

            <p>35. If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.</p>

            <p>36. Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.</p>
