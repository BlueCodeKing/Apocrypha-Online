            <h1><a href="index.html">Wisdom of Solomon</a></h1>
            <h2><a href="wisdom of solomon DRA.html">Chapter 7 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. I myself also am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.</p>

            <p>2. In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.</p>

            <p>3. And being born I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.</p>

            <p>4. I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.</p>

            <p>5. For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.</p>

            <p>6. For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.</p>

            <p>7. Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:</p>

            <p>8. And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.</p>

            <p>9. Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand, and silver in respect to her shall be counted as clay.</p>

            <p>10. I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.</p>

            <p>11. Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,</p>

            <p>12. And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all.</p>

            <p>13. Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.</p>

            <p>14. For she is an infinite treasure to men! which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gift of discipline.</p>

            <p>15. And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:</p>

            <p>16. For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.</p>

            <p>17. For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,</p>

            <p>18. The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,</p>

            <p>19. The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,</p>

            <p>20. The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,</p>

            <p>21. And all such things as are hid and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.</p>

            <p>22. For in her is the spirit of understanding: holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,</p>

            <p>23. Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits, intelligible, pure, subtile.</p>

            <p>24. For wisdom is more active than all active things: and reacheth everywhere by reason of her purity.</p>

            <p>25. For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.</p>

            <p>26. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness.</p>

            <p>27. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.</p>

            <p>28. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</p>

            <p>29. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</p>

            <p>30. For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.</p>
