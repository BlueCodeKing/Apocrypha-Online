            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 17 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. God created man of the earth, and made him after his own image.</p>

            <p>2. And he turned him into it again, and clothed him with strength according to himself.</p>

            <p>3. He gave him the number of his days and time, and gave him power over all things that are upon the earth.</p>

            <p>4. He put the fear of him upon all flesh, and he had dominion over beasts and fowls.</p>

            <p>5. He created of him a helpmate like to himself: he gave them counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, and ears, and a heart to devise: and he filled them with the knowledge of understanding.</p>

            <p>6. He created in them the science of the spirit, he filled their heart with wisdom, and shewed them both good and evil.</p>

            <p>7. He set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the greatness of his works:</p>

            <p>8. That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified: and glory in his wondrous acts, that they might declare the glorious things of his works.</p>

            <p>9. Moreover he gave them instructions, and the law of life for an inheritance.</p>

            <p>10. He made an everlasting covenant with them, and he shewed them his justice and judgments.</p>

            <p>11. And their eye saw the majesty of his glory. and their ears heard his glorious voice, and he said to them: Beware of all iniquity.</p>

            <p>12. And he gave to every one of them commandment concerning his neighbour.</p>

            <p>13. Their ways are always before him, they are not hidden from his eyes.</p>

            <p>14. Over every nation he set a ruler.</p>

            <p>15. And Israel was made the manifest portion of God.</p>

            <p>16. And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God: and his eyes are continually upon their ways.</p>

            <p>17. Their covenants were not hid by their iniquity, and all their iniquities are in the sight of God.</p>

            <p>18. The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and shall preserve the grace of a man as the apple of the eye:</p>

            <p>19. And afterward he shall rise up, and shall render them their reward, to every one upon their own head, and shall turn them down into the bowels of the earth.</p>

            <p>20. But to the penitent he hath given the way of justice, and he hath strengthened them that were fainting in patience, and hath appointed to them the lot of truth.</p>

            <p>21. Turn to the Lord, and forsake thy sins:</p>

            <p>22. Make thy prayer before the face of the Lord, and offend less.</p>

            <p>23. Return to the Lord, and turn away from thy injustice, and greatly hate abomination.</p>

            <p>24. And know the justices and judgments of God, and stand firm in the lot set before thee, and in prayer to the most high God.</p>

            <p>25. Go to the side of the holy age, with them that live and give praise to God.</p>

            <p>26. Tarry not in the error of the ungodly, give glory before death. Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing.</p>

            <p>27. Give thanks whilst thou art living, whilst thou art alive and in health thou shalt give thanks, and shalt praise God, and shalt glory in his mercies.</p>

            <p>28. How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness to them that turn to him!</p>

            <p>29. For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal, and they are delighted with the vanity of evil.</p>

            <p>30. What is brighter than the sun; yet it shall be eclipsed. Or what is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented? and this shall be reproved.</p>

            <p>31. He beholdeth the power of the height of heaven: and all men are earth and ashes.</p>
