            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 4 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.</p>

            <p>2. Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.</p>

            <p>3. Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to give to him that is in distress.</p>

            <p>4. Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.</p>

            <p>5. Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.</p>

            <p>6. For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.</p>

            <p>7. Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.</p>

            <p>8. Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.</p>

            <p>9. Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.</p>

            <p>10. In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.</p>

            <p>11. And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.</p>

            <p>12. Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.</p>

            <p>13. And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness.</p>

            <p>14. They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.</p>

            <p>15. They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.</p>

            <p>16. He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.</p>

            <p>17. If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.</p>

            <p>18. For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.</p>

            <p>19. She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.</p>

            <p>20. Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,</p>

            <p>21. And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.</p>

            <p>22. But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.</p>

            <p>23. Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.</p>

            <p>24. For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.</p>

            <p>25. For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.</p>

            <p>26. Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.</p>

            <p>27. Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:</p>

            <p>28. And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.</p>

            <p>29. For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.</p>

            <p>30. In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.</p>

            <p>31. Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.</p>

            <p>32. Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river.</p>

            <p>33. Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.</p>

            <p>34. Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.</p>

            <p>35. Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.</p>

            <p>36. Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.</p>
