            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 12 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be much thanks for thy good deeds.</p>

            <p>2. Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord.</p>

            <p>3. For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent.</p>

            <p>4. Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner: God will repay vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day of vengeance.</p>

            <p>5. Give to the good, and receive not a sinner.</p>

            <p>6. Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee.</p>

            <p>7. For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done to him: for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.</p>

            <p>8. A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not be hidden in adversity.</p>

            <p>9. In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved: and a friend is known in his adversity.</p>

            <p>10. Never trust thy enemy: for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth:</p>

            <p>11. Though he humble himself and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him.</p>

            <p>12. Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat: and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings.</p>

            <p>13. Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins.</p>

            <p>14. For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to decline, he will not endure it.</p>

            <p>15. An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.</p>

            <p>16. An enemy weepeth with his eyes: but if he find an opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood:</p>

            <p>17. And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first.</p>

            <p>18. An enemy hath tears in his eyes, and while he pretendeth to help thee, will undermine thy feet.</p>

            <p>19. He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.</p>
