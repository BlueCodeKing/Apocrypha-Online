            <p>1. Then Tobias called the angel to him, whom he took to be a man, and said to him: Brother Azarias, I pray thee hearken to my words:</p>

            <p>2. If I should give myself to be thy servant I should not make a worthy return for thy care.</p>

            <p>3. However, I beseech thee, to take with thee beasts and servants, and to go to Gabelus to Rages the city of the Medes: and to restore to him his note of hand, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my wedding.</p>

            <p>4. For thou knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I stay one day more, his soul will be afflicted.</p>

            <p>5. And indeed thou seest how Raguel hath adjured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise.</p>

            <p>6. Then Raphael took four of Raguel's servants, and two camels, and went to Rages the city of the Medes: and finding Gabelus, gave him his note of hand, and received of him all the money.</p>

            <p>7. And he told him concerning Tobias the son of Tobias, all that had been done: and made him come with him to the wedding.</p>

            <p>8. And when he was come into Raguel's house he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaped up, and they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God,</p>

            <p>9. And said: The God of Israel bless thee, because thou art the son of a very good and just man, and that feareth God, and doth almsdeeds:</p>

            <p>10. And may a blessing come upon thy wife and upon your parents.</p>

            <p>11. And may you see your children, and your children's children, unto the third and fourth generation: and may your seed be blessed by the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever.</p>

            <p>12. And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but the marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the Lord.</p>
