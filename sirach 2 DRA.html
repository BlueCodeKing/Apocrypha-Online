            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 2 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.</p>

            <p>2. Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.</p>

            <p>3. Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.</p>

            <p>4. Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.</p>

            <p>5. For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.</p>

            <p>6. Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein.</p>

            <p>7. Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye fall.</p>

            <p>8. Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.</p>

            <p>9. Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your delight.</p>

            <p>10. Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.</p>

            <p>11. My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.</p>

            <p>12. For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?</p>

            <p>13. For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth.</p>

            <p>14. Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways.</p>

            <p>15. Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him.</p>

            <p>16. Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.</p>

            <p>17. And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?</p>

            <p>18. They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.</p>

            <p>19. They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.</p>

            <p>20. They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls.</p>

            <p>21. They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,</p>

            <p>22. Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</p>

            <p>23. For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.</p>
