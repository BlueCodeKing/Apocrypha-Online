            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 28 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.</p>

            <p>2. Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurl thee: and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest.</p>

            <p>3. Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God?</p>

            <p>4. He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins?</p>

            <p>5. He that is but flesh, nourisheth anger, and doth he ask forgiveness of God? who shall obtain pardon for his sins?</p>

            <p>6. Remember thy last things, and let enmity cease:</p>

            <p>7. For corruption and death hang over in his commandments.</p>

            <p>8. Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour.</p>

            <p>9. Remember the covenant of the most High, and overlook the ignorance of thy neighbour.</p>

            <p>10. Refrain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins:</p>

            <p>11. For a passionate man kindleth strife, and a sinful man will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the midst of them that are at peace.</p>

            <p>12. For as the wood of the forest is, so the fire burneth: and as a man's strength is, so shall his anger be, and according to his riches he shall increase his anger.</p>

            <p>13. A hasty contention kindleth a fire: and a hasty quarrel sheddeth blood: and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death.</p>

            <p>14. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire: and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: both come out of the mouth.</p>

            <p>15. The whisperer and the double tongued is accursed: for he hath troubled many that were at peace.</p>

            <p>16. The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many, and scattered them from nation to nation.</p>

            <p>17. It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich, and hath overthrown the houses of great men.</p>

            <p>18. It hath cut in pieces the forces of people, and undone strong nations.</p>

            <p>19. The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women, and deprived them of their labours.</p>

            <p>20. He that hearkeneth to it, shall never have rest, neither shall he have a friend in whom he may repose.</p>

            <p>21. The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones.</p>

            <p>22. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have perished by their own tongue.</p>

            <p>23. Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue, that hath not passed into the wrath thereof, and that hath not drawn the yoke thereof, and hath not been bound in its bands.</p>

            <p>24. For its yoke is a yoke of iron: and its bands are bands of brass.</p>

            <p>25. The death thereof is a most evil death: and hell is preferable to it.</p>

            <p>26. Its continuance shall not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its flame.</p>

            <p>27. They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it shall tear them.</p>

            <p>28. Hedge in thy ears with thorns, hear not a wicked tongue, and make doors and bars to thy mouth.</p>

            <p>29. Melt down thy gold and silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a just bridle for thy mouth:</p>

            <p>30. And take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue, and fall in the sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be incurable unto death.</p>
