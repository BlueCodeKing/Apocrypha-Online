            <h1><a href="index.html">Prayer of Azariah</a></h1>
            <h2><a href="prayer of azariah DRA.html">Chapter 1 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord.</p>

            <p>2. Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said:</p>

            <p>3. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and thy name is worthy of praise, and glorious for ever:</p>

            <p>4. For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments true.</p>

            <p>5. For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers: for according to truth and judgment, thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins.</p>

            <p>6. For we have sinned, and committed iniquity, departing from thee: and we have trespassed in all things:</p>

            <p>7. And we have not hearkened to thy commandments, nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might go well with us.</p>

            <p>8. Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment:</p>

            <p>9. And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are unjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and to a king unjust, and most wicked beyond all that are upon the earth.</p>

            <p>10. And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee.</p>

            <p>11. Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name's sake, and abolish not thy covenant.</p>

            <p>12. And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy holy one:</p>

            <p>13. To whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea shore.</p>

            <p>14. For we, O Lord, are diminished more than any nation, and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins.</p>

            <p>15. Neither is there at this time prince, or leader, or prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of firstfruits before thee,</p>

            <p>16. That we may find thy mercy: nevertheless in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted.</p>

            <p>17. As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee.</p>

            <p>18. And now we follow thee with all our heart, and we fear thee, and seek thy face.</p>

            <p>19. Put us not to confusion, but deal. with us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</p>

            <p>20. And deliver us according to thy wonderful works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord:</p>

            <p>21. And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be broken.</p>

            <p>22. And let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and glorious over all the world.</p>

            <p>23. Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone, and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks,</p>

            <p>24. And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits:</p>

            <p>25. And it broke forth, and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found near the furnace.</p>

            <p>26. But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his companions into the furnace: and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace,</p>

            <p>27. And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind bringing dew, and the fire touched them not at all, nor troubled them, nor did them any harm.</p>

            <p>28. Then these three as with one mouth praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:</p>

            <p>29. Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of our fathers: and worthy to be praised, and glorified, and exalted above all for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and worthy to be praised, and exalted above all in all ages.</p>

            <p>30. Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory: and exceedingly to be praised, and exceeding glorious for ever.</p>

            <p>31. Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom, and exceedingly to be praised, and exalted above all for ever.</p>

            <p>32. Blessed art thou, that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</p>

            <p>33. Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and worthy of praise, and glorious for ever.</p>

            <p>34. All ye works of the Lord, bless the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever.</p>
