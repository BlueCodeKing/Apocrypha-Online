            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 34 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.</p>

            <p>2. The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.</p>

            <p>3. The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.</p>

            <p>4. What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?</p>

            <p>5. Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:</p>

            <p>6. And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set no thy heart upon them.</p>

            <p>7. For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.</p>

            <p>8. The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.</p>

            <p>9. What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.</p>

            <p>10. He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.</p>

            <p>11. He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.</p>

            <p>12. I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.</p>

            <p>13. Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.</p>

            <p>14. The spirit of those that fear God; is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.</p>

            <p>15. For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.</p>

            <p>16. He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid for he is his hope.</p>

            <p>17. The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.</p>

            <p>18. To whom doth he look, and who in his strength?</p>

            <p>19. The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,</p>

            <p>20. A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling; he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.</p>

            <p>21. The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.</p>

            <p>22. The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.</p>

            <p>23. The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.</p>

            <p>24. He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.</p>

            <p>25. The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.</p>

            <p>26. He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.</p>

            <p>27. He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, are brothers.</p>

            <p>28. When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?</p>

            <p>29. When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?</p>

            <p>30. He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?</p>

            <p>31. So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?</p>
