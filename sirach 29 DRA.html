            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 29 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. He that sheweth mercy, lendeth to his neighbour: and he that is stronger in hand, keepeth the commandments.</p>

            <p>2. Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due time.</p>

            <p>3. Reap thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou shalt always find that which is necessary for thee.</p>

            <p>4. Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have given trouble to them that helped them.</p>

            <p>5. Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in promises they humble their voice:</p>

            <p>6. But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return tedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:</p>

            <p>7. And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found it:</p>

            <p>8. But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get him for an enemy without cause:</p>

            <p>9. And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of honour and good turn will repay him injuries.</p>

            <p>10. Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.</p>

            <p>11. But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to shew him mercy.</p>

            <p>12. Help the poor because of the commandment: and send him not away empty handed because of his poverty.</p>

            <p>13. Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend: and hide it not under a stone to be lost.</p>

            <p>14. Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</p>

            <p>15. Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and it shall obtain help for thee against all evil.</p>

            <p>16. Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the spear:</p>

            <p>17. It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.</p>

            <p>18. A good man is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath lost shame, will leave him to himself.</p>

            <p>19. Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given his life for thee.</p>

            <p>20. The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety.</p>

            <p>21. A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety: and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.</p>

            <p>22. A man is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost all shame, he shall forsake him.</p>

            <p>23. Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath tossed them as a wave of the sea.</p>

            <p>24. It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about, and they have wandered in strange countries.</p>

            <p>25. A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord, shall fall into an evil suretyship: and he that undertaketh many things, shall fall into judgment.</p>

            <p>26. Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to thyself that thou fall not.</p>

            <p>27. The chief thing for man's life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame.</p>

            <p>28. Better is the poor man's fare under a roof of boards, than sumptuous cheer abroad in another man's house.</p>

            <p>29. Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt not hear the reproach of going abroad.</p>

            <p>30. It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house: for where a man is a stranger, he shall not deal confidently, nor open his mouth.</p>

            <p>31. He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the unthankful, and moreover he shall hear bitter words.</p>

            <p>32. Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to eat what thou hast in thy hand.</p>

            <p>33. Give place to the honourable presence of my friends: for I want my house, my brother being to be lodged with me.</p>

            <p>34. These things are grievous to a man of understanding: the upbraiding of houseroom, and the reproaching of the lender.</p>
