            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 8 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Strive not with a powerful man, lest thou fall into his hands.</p>

            <p>2. Contend not with a rich man, lest he bring an action against thee.</p>

            <p>3. For gold and silver hath destroyed many, and hath reached even to the heart of kings, and perverted them.</p>

            <p>4. Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.</p>

            <p>5. Communicate not with an ignorant man, lest he speak ill of thy family.</p>

            <p>6. Despise not a man that turneth away from sin, nor reproach him therewith: remember that we are all worthy of reproof.</p>

            <p>7. Despise not a man in his old age; for we also shall become old.</p>

            <p>8. Rejoice not at the death of thy enemy; knowing that we all die, and are not willing that others should rejoice at our death.</p>

            <p>9. Despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs.</p>

            <p>10. For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and instruction of understanding, and to serve great men without blame.</p>

            <p>11. Let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee, for they have learned of their fathers:</p>

            <p>12. For of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give an answer in time of need.</p>

            <p>13. Kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them, lest thou be burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins.</p>

            <p>14. Stand not against the face of an injurious person, lest he sit as a spy to entrap thee in thy words.</p>

            <p>15. Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself: and if thou lendest, count it as lost.</p>

            <p>16. Be not surety above thy power: and if thou be surety, think as if thou wert to pay it.</p>

            <p>17. Judge not against a judge: for he judgeth according to that which is just.</p>

            <p>18. Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he burden thee with his evils: for he goeth according to his own will, and thou shalt perish together with his folly.</p>

            <p>19. Quarrel not with a passionate man, and go not into the desert with a bold man: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help he will overthrow thee.</p>

            <p>20. Advise not with fools, for they cannot love but such things as please them.</p>

            <p>21. Before a stranger do no matter of counsel: for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.</p>

            <p>22. Open not thy heart to every man: lest he repay thee with an evil turn, and speak reproachfully to thee.
