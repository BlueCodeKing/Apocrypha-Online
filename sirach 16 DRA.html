            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 16 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Rejoice not in ungodly children, if they be multiplied: neither be delighted in them, if the fear of God be not with them.</p>

            <p>2. Trust not to their life, and respect not their labours.</p>

            <p>3. For better is one that feareth God, than a thousand ungodly children.</p>

            <p>4. And it is better to die without children, than to leave ungodly children.</p>

            <p>5. By one that is wise a country shall be inhabited, the tribe of the ungodly shall become desolate.</p>

            <p>6. Many such things hath my eyes seen, and greater things than these my ear hath heard.</p>

            <p>7. In the congregation of sinners a fire shall be kindled, and in an unbelieving nation wrath shall dame out.</p>

            <p>8. The ancient giants did not obtain pardon for their sins, who were destroyed trusting to their own strength:</p>

            <p>9. And he spared not the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for the pride of their word.</p>

            <p>10. He had not pity on them, destroying the whole nation that extolled themselves in their sins.</p>

            <p>11. So did he with the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their heart: and if one had been stiffnecked, it is a wonder if he had escaped unpunished:</p>

            <p>12. For mercy and wrath are with him. He is mighty to forgive, and to pour out indignation:</p>

            <p>13. According as his mercy is, so his correction judgeth a man according to his works.</p>

            <p>14. The sinner shall not escape in his rapines, and the patience of him that sheweth mercy shall not be put off.</p>

            <p>15. All mercy shall make a place for every man according to the merit of his works, and according to the wisdom of his sojournment.</p>

            <p>16. Say not: I shall be hidden from God. and who shall remember me from on high?</p>

            <p>17. In such a multitude I shall not be known: for what is my soul in such an immense creation?</p>

            <p>18. Behold the heaven, and the heavens of heavens, the deep, and all the earth, and the things that are in them, shall be moved in his sight,</p>

            <p>19. The mountains also, and the hills, and the foundations of the earth: when God shall look upon them, they shall be shaken with trembling.</p>

            <p>20. And in all these things the heart is senseless: and every heart is understood by him:</p>

            <p>21. And his ways who shall understand, and the storm, which no eye of man see?</p>

            <p>22. For many of his works are hidden: hut the works of his justice who shall declare? or who shall endure? for the testament is far from some, and the examination of all is in the end.</p>

            <p>23. He that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things: and the foolish, and erring man, thinketh foolish things.</p>

            <p>24. Hearken to me, my son, and learn the discipline of understanding, and attend to my words in thy heart.</p>

            <p>25. And I will shew forth good doctrine in equity, and will seek to declare wisdom: and attend to my words in thy heart, whilst with equity of spirit I tell thee the virtues that God hath put upon his works from the beginning, and I shew forth in truth his knowledge.</p>

            <p>26. The works of God are done in judgment from the beginning, and from the making of them he distinguished their parts, and their beginnings in their generations.</p>

            <p>27. He beautified their works for ever, they have neither hungered, nor laboured, and they have not ceased from their works.</p>

            <p>28. Nor shall any of them straiten his neighbour at any time.</p>

            <p>29. Be not thou incredulous to his word.</p>

            <p>30. After this God looked upon the earth, and filled it with his goods.</p>

            <p>31. The soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before the face thereof, and into it they return again.</p>
