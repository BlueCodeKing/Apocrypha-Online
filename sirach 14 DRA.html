            <h2><a href="sirach DRA.html">Chapter 14 | Version DRA</a></h2>

            <p>1. Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.</p>

            <p>2. Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.</p>

            <p>3. Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?</p>

            <p>4. He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.</p>

            <p>5. He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.</p>

            <p>6. There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness:</p>

            <p>7. And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his wickedness.</p>

            <p>8. The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.</p>

            <p>9. The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.</p>

            <p>10. An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.</p>

            <p>11. My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.</p>

            <p>12. Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.</p>

            <p>13. Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.</p>

            <p>14. Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift overpass thee.</p>

            <p>15. Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?</p>

            <p>16. Give and take, and justify thy soul.</p>

            <p>17. Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.</p>

            <p>18. All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that springeth out on a green tree.</p>

            <p>19. Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.</p>

            <p>20. Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and the worker thereof shall go with it.</p>

            <p>21. And every excellent work shall be justified: and the worker thereof shall be honoured therein.</p>

            <p>22. Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye of God.</p>

            <p>23. He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that traceth, and stayeth in her ways:</p>

            <p>24. He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her door:</p>

            <p>25. He that lodgeth near her house, and fastening a pin in her walls shall set up his tent nigh unto her, where good things shall rest in his lodging for ever.</p>

            <p>26. He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches:</p>

            <p>27. He shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.</p>
